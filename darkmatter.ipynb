As its name implies, dark matter does not absorb nor reflect electromagnetic radiation (light), so we cannot rely on visual detection of this matter. Instead, our knowledge of the laws of gravity and motion led to the discovery of dark matter.\n",

    "In this activity, you will be computing the *total mass* of the galaxy NGC 2742 using these same gravitational laws, and comparing/contrasting this against the mass one would estimate from the matter we can see, otherwise known as the *luminous mass*. Since the overwhelming majority of this mass is represented by stars, this is also referred to as a galaxy's *stellar mass*. To do this, you will be using real rotation data collected by Vera Rubin et al. in 1985, and an analytical model of the galaxy's integrated light.\n",
